yc 8 mark II
Breakin:

This was my second party and I must tell you about something quite stupid that happened on our way there. It was me and Fnordman (and my father driving the car). I had of course forgot to print the map to the partyplace and we had nothing to go on. We just had som general hints.

Everyone that knew where it was were on their way there so we could not call anyone.
We kept driving in the industrial area around Gyproc for one hour (we even were at the yc-neighbours place), asking people for help. 
Finally we stopped at a gas-store and when they could not help us we asked if we could rig up our computer. So we did.
At the floor of the store we sat and used the dos-edit (no mouse, keyboard only) and looked at the map. Then we found the party.

"Uppfinnarmässa vadå?"
